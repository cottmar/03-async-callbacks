## Overview
This app reads all files in an array and prints them to the console. It also makes an array holding the text of those files.

## Getting Started
After forking the repo, install all needed dependencies. The user will then need to create text files with text of their choice (I used information on U.S. States), and create a function to read those files. Then, another function will need to be added that iterates through the array of file paths, invoking the file-reading function for each file path that logs the contents of the file to the console. 

##  Documentation
The exported values are the fileReader.readDataFilesAsync = (filePath, callback) function.
